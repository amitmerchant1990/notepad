Notepad
========

[![Notepad Cover Image](/art/cover.png)](https://notepad.js.org/)

This is an offline-capable [Notepad](https://notepad.js.org/) which uses the [Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) behind the scenes.

## Subtools

I recently added a bunch of tools that I thought might go along with the regular Notepad — making notepad.js.org a one-stop shop for all the note-taking related needs a step closer.

- [Rich Text Editor](https://notepad.js.org/rich-text-editor/)
- [Markdown Editor](https://notepad.js.org/markdown-editor/)
- [Pomodoro Timer](https://notepad.js.org/pomodoro-timer/)
