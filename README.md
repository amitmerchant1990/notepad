Notepad
========

[![Notepad Cover Image](/art/cover.png)](https://notepad.js.org/)

This is an offline-capable [Notepad](https://notepad.js.org/) which uses the [Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) behind the scenes.

> Read about the [story of how I built it](https://www.amitmerchant.com/Building-Simple-Offline-Notepad-Using-Service-Worker/).

## Notable features

  - Lets you **write notes in plain text** which are autosaved [locally](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).
  - [Installable](https://www.amitmerchant.com/adding-custom-install-button-in-progressive-web-apps/) on supported browsers for offline usage.
  - **"Add To Home Screen"** feature on Android supported devices to launch the app from home screen.
  - Editor padding.
  - Font settings.
  - Supports **monospaced** and **dyslexic fonts**.
  - Word and character count.
  - Minimal UI.
  - Keyboard shortcuts for common actions.
  - Dark mode.
  - Focus mode (on desktop).
  - Optimal line length for better reading experience.
  - [Floating window](https://www.amitmerchant.com/implementing-interactive-floating-windows-using-picture-in-picture-api/) to effectively take notes on top of other apps (in [supported browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Picture-in-Picture_API))
  - Download notes as **plain text** or **PDF**.
  - Ability to play ambient noise—**coffee shop**, **rain**, **fireside**, etc.—to help you focus.

## Mini tools

I recently added a bunch of tools that I thought might go along with the regular Notepad — making notepad.js.org a one-stop shop for all the note-taking related needs a step closer.

- [Case Converter](https://notepad.js.org/case-converter/)
- [Tasks](https://notepad.js.org/tasks/)
